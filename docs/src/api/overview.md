## Type parameters

The following are common type parameters that appear throughout the package:

* `uType` - Element type of the state vector of a DE function or problem. Typically a subtype of `Real`.
* `tType` - Type of time variable used in a DE function or problem. Typically a subtype of `Real`.
* `isinplace` - Boolean value which indicates whether a DE function operates in-place (sets values of an array passed as its first argument rather than returning a new array).
  Also appears as `iip`.
* `ND`  - TODO
